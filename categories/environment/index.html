         	<p>The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a ten-year high, according to data obtained by campaigners.</p>
<p>Surfers Against Sewage said the Environment Agency data showed the number of incidents was more than double its target.</p>
<p>Such spills have the potential to cause damage to wildlife and illness for people making use of the country&rsquo;s rivers and seas.</p>
<p>Water UK, the industry body representing UK water and sewage companies, said companies plan to invest £12bn to reduce spills by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>Since privatisation, the water companies have taken billions of pounds in dividends while delivering polluted rivers and beaches. They must pay to clean this up and not pass the costs on to their hard-pressed customers. Unfortunately, the regulator and government don&rsquo;t seem to be on the side of the public.</p>

         	<p>If you live in the UK, you will have noticed the increased level of interest in the discharge of sewage into our rivers and seas. The government is concerned about the impact of this on the upcoming local elections and is talking tough but doing nothing.</p>
<p>The situation with raw sewage also affects businesses. For instance, we live in South Devon, where we are fortunate to have access to some of the best beaches in the UK. One of which, Blackpool Sands was voted the &ldquo;best beach in Britain,” according to the blurb on the <a href="https://www.blackpoolsands.co.uk/" title="Link to the Blackpool Sands website">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s golden beach, set in an unspoilt, sheltered bay, lapped by clear blue water and surrounded by magnificent evergreens and pines. Blackpool Sands is the ideal family beach to relax, swim or sail. But don’t just take our word for it – come and see for yourself! Relax or play; it’s South Devon’s most beautiful beach any day!</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="uploads/2023/48e40598d6.png" width="600" height="400" alt="photo of Blackpool sands, devon, uk" border=“1” />
<p>The owners of Blackpool Sands have invested a lot of money over the winter in new and upgraded facilities. I can&rsquo;t imagine how they feel learning that, according to the Independent newspaper, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/beach-sewage-water-pollution-england-b2315279.html" title="Link to the Independent article">Blackpool Sands ranks the worst for seaside sewage spillage</a> as shown in the following graphic.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/6cef3b0ccf.png" width="600" height="382" alt="graphic showing polluted beaches in the south-west, uk" border=“1” />
<p>Since privatisation in 1989, private water companies in England* have underinvested in pollution prevention to boost profits*.</p>
<p><strong>They’ve built a debt mountain of £53bn, while giving shareholders £72bn!</strong></p>
<p>Attempts to regulate them have failed. Under privatisation, it clearly pays to pollute.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. The UK’s most trusted utility company is publicly owned Scottish Water. They’ve spent £72 more per household per year than English water companies. That’s equivalent to an extra £28 billion being invested in England’s water network!</p>

         	<p>Despite it raining in Devon almost every day since we moved here in October last year, South West Water is imposing a hosepipe ban on us from 25th April.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/caafe8d9f4.png" width="600" height="314" alt="south west water hosepipe ban" />
<blockquote>
<p>Since last summer, our region has been in drought.  Low rainfall and high demand have stopped our reservoirs from recovering to levels we would usually see going into the summer.  Roadford Lake, our main reservoir in Devon, remains around 27% lower than this time last year, despite the recent rain.

</blockquote>
<p>We must rethink how our utilities are run, as these companies have a monopoly over the consumer. We have no choice over who supplies our water, so they can charge what they like and impose restrictions on the service.</p>

<p>The government has backed legislation which would stop hunters from bringing back body parts of thousands of species, including lions, rhinos, elephants and polar bears, killed abroad.
Tory MP Henry Smith, who proposed the bill, said it would help conserve the world&rsquo;s most endangered species.
It was approved by MPs and will now face further scrutiny in the Lords.
As it has the support of the government, the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill is likely to become law.</p>

         	<p>It beggars belief that the UK government is telling businesses they can dump raw sewage into our rivers because of Brexit-related issues with the supply chain. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Sunlit Uplands&rdquo;</em> will start to stink if this carries on much longer.</p>
<p>This is the quote from today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inside Politics&rdquo; email from The Independent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Brexit just a load of crap? Amid the well-documented supply chain and lorry driver shortage crises, ministers have given businesses the green light to dump the brown stuff in Britain’s rivers. Some companies have found it more difficult to get hold of water treatment chemicals because of supply chain disruption at ports blamed primarily on the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Environment Agency this week said companies struggling to get hold of such products would be allowed to “discharge effluent without meeting the conditions” of their permits, which normally require water to be treated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Green Party is furious. Amelia Womack, deputy leader, said: “This is a failure of their understanding on how our country’s most basic infrastructure works and using our environment as a dumping ground rather than addressing the root causes of the problem. “To prevent further Brexit chaos and undermining of environmental protections, the government must work to mend supply chains and work to cooperate rather than trying to look ‘tough’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The government says the measures are “strictly time-limited and there are robust conditions in place to mitigate risks to the environment”. Maybe best to avoid wild swimming for a while.</p>
