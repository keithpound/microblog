         	<p><strong>Goodbye Evernote, hello Craft.</strong> I&rsquo;ve done what I thought was unthinkable. After using Evernote for over a dozen years, I just cancelled my subscription and started using <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a> as my full time note taking application. I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.</p>

<p>I have recently started to use <a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses app">Ulysses</a> for all my extended and short-form writing and was intrigued to read that the authors added the ability to publish to micro.blog in the latest release.</p>
<p>I built my <a href="https://keithpound.com/" title="KeithPound.com">website</a> on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/" title="Elegant Themes site">Elegant Themes</a>. Whilst I’m happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp; Divi provides, it’s difficult to justify the annual cost of around £85 a year for a hobby blog.</p>
<p>Ulysses posts to WordPress, but the formatting doesn’t work with the Extra theme, so it wasn’t a viable option. This limitation and the cost were why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.</p>
<p>Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward — you select “Publishing” as the export option and select the blog to post to, its status (draft, publish or schedule when it’s posted), and choose a category. 📝<br></p>
