      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the first time in 14 years that none of my computers or devices have Evernote installed. All of my note-taking and writing will be via Obsidian from now on. ‚úèÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goodbye Evernote, hello Craft.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve done what I thought was unthinkable. After using Evernote for over a dozen years, I just cancelled my subscription and started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.craft.do/&#34;&gt;Craft&lt;/a&gt; as my full time note taking application. I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&amp;rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Working with Ulysses &amp; Micro.blog</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&#34;uploads/2023/bd8cb644f2.png&#34; width=&#34;100&#34; height=&#34;100&#34; alt=&#34;ulysses logo&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently started to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://ulysses.app/&#34; title=&#34;Ulysses app&#34;&gt;Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; for all my extended and short-form writing and was intrigued to read that the authors added the ability to publish to micro.blog in the latest release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built my &lt;a href=&#34;https://keithpound.com/&#34; title=&#34;KeithPound.com&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elegantthemes.com/&#34; title=&#34;Elegant Themes site&#34;&gt;Elegant Themes&lt;/a&gt;. Whilst I‚Äôm happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp;amp; Divi provides, it‚Äôs difficult to justify the annual cost of around ¬£85 a year for a hobby blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulysses posts to WordPress, but the formatting doesn‚Äôt work with the Extra theme, so it wasn‚Äôt a viable option. This limitation and the cost were why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward ‚Äî you select ‚ÄúPublishing‚Äù as the export option and select the blog to post to, its status (draft, publish or schedule when it‚Äôs posted), and choose a category. üìù&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
