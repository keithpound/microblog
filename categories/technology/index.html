        <a href="https://keithpound.com/2023/04/12/roonnot-only-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-12 18:04:02 &#43;0100">Apr 12, 2023</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Why invest in Roon when Apple‚Äôs Music (the app, not the service) and Spotify are ‚Äúfree?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>I wanted to use Apple Music to bring all my music into one place, consisting of over 2,000 albums I&rsquo;ve ripped or purchased that sat on a Synology NAS and music from Apple‚Äôs streaming service. Unfortunately, this approach didn&rsquo;t work because Apple struggled to match my albums with the versions on its servers.</p>
<p>After days spent watching Apple Music processing &amp; uploading, I gave up. The workaround was to have two Apple Music libraries, one for digital files and another for streaming music, which wasn&rsquo;t an elegant or practical solution.</p>
<p>I own a Naim Uniti Atom, which supports Apple‚Äôs service via AirPlay, but Spotify, Tidal and Qobuz are better integrated. I‚Äôve used Spotify for many years and still have a free account, but the continued lack of high-res content left me looking for another provider. I tried Tidal but grew tired of the way they push music I don‚Äôt like at me. Ultimately, I settled on Qobuz, and bought a 12-month subscription.</p>
<p>I still didn‚Äôt have all of my music in one place. After some research during the Christmas break, I signed up for a 14-day trial of <a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/czdqgYpSAUmSVciCHmxNpA">Roon</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a test, I installed Roon on my MacBook Air, pointed it at a subset of my music collection, added my Qobuz subscription, sat back whilst Roon scanned my music and installed the mobile app on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Roon must always be on and connected to the Internet to work correctly, so using my MacBook as the Roon server wasn‚Äôt a long-term solution. I couldn‚Äôt use my Synology NAS as it was in storage between houses, and the spec was too low to support Roon.</p>
<p>As an interim solution, I bought a &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo; NUC from eBay. I installed Roon ROCK, which is a dedicated operating system and Roon core with the music files located on an external SSD drive. It&rsquo;s a relatively old i5 model but came with 16Gb RAM. It sits in the kitchen, next to the router and has never missed a beat.</p>
<p>It manages almost 30,000 tracks across my music and what I&rsquo;ve saved as favourites in Qobuz.</p>

<p>In Part 2, I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits of using Roon.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôve flipped between both over the years, but currently using Spotify as I got a free six-month subscription when I bought a Sonos sound bar before Christmas. That‚Äôs about to expire, and it‚Äôs time to stump up ¬£9.99 a month.</p>
<p><em>The question is, should I go back to Tidal or stick where I am?</em></p>
<p>I listen to music on my MacBook, iPad, my phone and a couple of Sonos speakers located throughout the house. We also have a Naim streamer in the lounge, which means that I can make the best use of a high-quality source as provided by Tidal‚Äôs HiFi tier.</p>
<p>Spotify uses its Connect technology to send music to the Naim, whereas Tidal integrates with the Naim app, making for a more involved experience.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the puzzle is to have a sound off, play the same track on Spotify and Tidal and check whether I can hear a difference between the two to justify paying ¬£20 a month for Tidal.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve signed up for a 30-day Tidal trial. Let the games begin!</p>

         	<p><strong>Goodbye Evernote, hello Craft.</strong> I&rsquo;ve done what I thought was unthinkable. After using Evernote for over a dozen years, I just cancelled my subscription and started using <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a> as my full time note taking application. I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.</p>

         	<p>I‚Äôve just completed the signup process for a Micro.blog subscription and will be moving some posts from my old WordPress site across to micro.blog over the coming days.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve decided to use the Arabica theme for the web and have made a couple of small changes to the Archive page, to keep links looking the same across the site ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt like the Nav bar looking and behaving different from the Categories on the Archive page. I just need to work out how to get the Categories to display horizontally now. I tried to use CSS to style them, but whilst I can change colours, etc., ‚Äúdisplay: inline‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work as you&rsquo;ll see below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Happy to take advice from anyone who has more experience using CSS than I do ‚Äî which‚Äôll be pretty much everyone.</p>
<p>My next challenge is to style the dates on the Archive page to look like the dates on the rest of the theme.</p>
<p>Still to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide whether to keep my old domain name and transfer it to Micro.blog</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, by the way, this post was written in Ulysses and published direct to the blog.</p>

         	<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I have recently started to use <a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses app">Ulysses</a> for all my extended and short-form writing and was intrigued to read that the authors added the ability to publish to micro.blog in the latest release.</p>
<p>I built my <a href="https://keithpound.com/" title="KeithPound.com">website</a> on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/" title="Elegant Themes site">Elegant Themes</a>. Whilst I‚Äôm happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp; Divi provides, it‚Äôs difficult to justify the annual cost of around ¬£85 a year for a hobby blog.</p>
<p>Ulysses posts to WordPress, but the formatting doesn‚Äôt work with the Extra theme, so it wasn‚Äôt a viable option. This limitation and the cost were why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.</p>
<p>Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward ‚Äî you select ‚ÄúPublishing‚Äù as the export option and select the blog to post to, its status (draft, publish or schedule when it‚Äôs posted), and choose a category. üìù<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
