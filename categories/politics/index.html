<p>Step up Brexit reset, or European allies will lose patience, Starmer warned.
The call comes after Bank of England’s governor Andrew Bailey said the UK should rebuild relations with the European Union as he warned of the economic consequences of leaving the bloc.</p>

         	<p>If you live in the UK, you will have noticed the increased level of interest in the discharge of sewage into our rivers and seas. The government is concerned about the impact of this on the upcoming local elections and is talking tough but doing nothing.</p>
<p>The situation with raw sewage also affects businesses. For instance, we live in South Devon, where we are fortunate to have access to some of the best beaches in the UK. One of which, Blackpool Sands was voted the &ldquo;best beach in Britain,” according to the blurb on the <a href="https://www.blackpoolsands.co.uk/" title="Link to the Blackpool Sands website">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s golden beach, set in an unspoilt, sheltered bay, lapped by clear blue water and surrounded by magnificent evergreens and pines. Blackpool Sands is the ideal family beach to relax, swim or sail. But don’t just take our word for it – come and see for yourself! Relax or play; it’s South Devon’s most beautiful beach any day!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The owners of Blackpool Sands have invested a lot of money over the winter in new and upgraded facilities. I can&rsquo;t imagine how they feel learning that, according to the Independent newspaper, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/beach-sewage-water-pollution-england-b2315279.html" title="Link to the Independent article">Blackpool Sands ranks the worst for seaside sewage spillage</a> as shown in the following graphic.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since privatisation in 1989, private water companies in England* have underinvested in pollution prevention to boost profits*.</p>
<p><strong>They’ve built a debt mountain of £53bn, while giving shareholders £72bn!</strong></p>
<p>Attempts to regulate them have failed. Under privatisation, it clearly pays to pollute.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. The UK’s most trusted utility company is publicly owned Scottish Water. They’ve spent £72 more per household per year than English water companies. That’s equivalent to an extra £28 billion being invested in England’s water network!</p>

<p><strong>Send the Government a clear message: stop privatisation, stop the sewage.</strong></p>

         	<p>In case you’re still wondering who to vote for in this May’s local elections, here’s a list of Tory achievements during the last thirteen years:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 sure start centres closed.</li>
<li>780 libraries closed.</li>
<li>700 football pitches closed.</li>
<li>Food bank use is up 5,400%.</li>
<li>Homelessness is up 1,000%.</li>
<li>Rough sleeping up 1,200%</li>
<li>Evictions at record highs.</li>
<li>Student fees are up 300%.</li>
<li>Student debt has risen 150%.</li>
<li>Eradication of EMA (education maintenance allowance).</li>
<li>National debt has risen from £850billion to £2.25trillion.</li>
<li>GBP fell by around 15% versus EUR and USD.</li>
<li>Manufacturing in recession.</li>
<li>Construction in recession.</li>
<li>Services close to recession.</li>
<li>25-30% cuts to all govt departments.</li>
<li>25,000 fewer police.</li>
<li>20,000 fewer prison officers.</li>
<li>10,000 fewer border officials.</li>
<li>10,000 fewer firefighters.</li>
<li>10,000 fewer medical professionals.</li>
<li>14,000 fewer bed spaces for mental illness.</li>
<li>Creation of 1.3m jobs, mainly temporary, self-employed, gig economy and Zero Hours Contract.</li>
<li>Only 30k full-time work positions were created.</li>
<li>25% cuts for our disabled community.</li>
<li>80% cuts to Mobility allowance.</li>
<li>Closing Remploy.</li>
<li>40% of working households with practically no savings.</li>
<li>70% of households have less than 10k savings.</li>
<li>60% of households can only survive 2 months without a wage.</li>
<li>Increase of 50% in hate crimes.</li>
<li>Increase knife crime by 150% to 22,000 per year.</li>
<li>Life expectancy down 3 years.</li>
<li>Voted down a bill which would have forced landlords to make their rental properties fit for human habitation</li>
<li>NHS satisfaction level at lowest recorded rate.</li>
<li>Council home building down 90%.</li>
<li>200k social homes lost since 2010.</li>
<li>Zero starter homes built, despite the Tory flagship programme.</li>
<li>36,000 fewer teachers.</li>
<li>Six form funding cut by 25%.</li>
<li>33,000 nurses leave the NHS each year.</li>
<li>14 prisons closed down, and the land was sold to developers.</li>
<li>50% of all police stations closed.</li>
<li>300 + courts closed down, leading to a huge backlog.</li>
<li>Millions to a shipping company with no ships</li>
<li>Economy the worst in Europe</li>
<li>Billions to Tory Donors for PPE that either didn&rsquo;t work or never turned up.</li>
<li>Brexit deal that has seen the economy drop even further and exports evaporate.</li>
<li>Repeatedly broke laws they&rsquo;d only just made and had parties whilst the rest sacrificed</li>
<li>Largest tax increase for 70 years whilst the chancellor&rsquo;s wife and rich people like her simply avoid it.</li>
<li>Crashed the pound.</li>
<li>Chancellor of the Exchequer on the fiddle and fined by HMRC</li>
<li>Voted to allow water companies to dump raw sewage in our rivers and seas for the next 15 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad news, though. Although inflation is at a 40-year high, at least corporate profits are at 70-year record levels, so that’s good.</p>
<p>PS - here’s a tip for any grovelling Tory apologists. Save time and brain-ache by selecting one or more of the following responses:</p>
<p>Option 1 response “None of this is true”</p>
<p>Option 2 response “It’s all true, but it&rsquo;s Labour’s fault”</p>
<p>Option 3 response “More leftie nonsense”</p>
<p>Option 4 response “Labour would have been worse”</p>

<p>UK government ministers were accused of a “<strong>dereliction of duty</strong>” today for not providing anyone for the media round this morning, leaving presenters to ask why no one from the government was prepared to face the public. This followed the energy regulator <strong>Ofgem announcing that the price cap will increase to £3,549 on 1st October</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast, Lisa Nandy (Labour’s shadow chancellor) appeared on BBC Breakfast and called on the government to follow Labour’s lead and freeze energy bills. She said, “<em>The fact that no Government minister is available to come on your programme today is just appalling. They are not here to give assurances, they are not here to set out what they are going to do. That is a dereliction of duty.</em>”</p>

         	<p>What happened in the House of Commons yesterday was so foul, the stench might never clear.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What happened on Wednesday afternoon in the House of Commons was absolutely not a politician making the rules then failing to abide by them himself. It was a politician, having been found utterly in breach of them, entirely and unequivocally bang to rights, and responding by having his mates, and the government itself, just rip the rules up altogether.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson has sparked outrage on the eve of the Conservative Party conference after saying “never mind” about cancer death rates and the recent fall in life expectancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grilled about his plans for Britain’s recovery from the Covid crisis, the prime minister chose to emphasis economic growth over health measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pointing to the recent growth in wages, Mr Johnson told the BBC: “I’ve given you the most important metric – never mind life expectancy, never mind cancer outcomes – look at wage growth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Opposition parties pounced the prime minister’s remarks, with Labour accusing him of showing an “outrageous” disregard for the health of British citizens.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told The Independent: “Boris Johnson starts his conference with the most chilling words ever spoken from a prime minister dismissing the importance of cancer outcomes.”</p>

			<h1><a href="https://keithpound.com/2021/09/08/did-they-fix.html">Did they fix UK social care or just kick the can down the road?</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://keithpound.com/2021/09/08/did-they-fix.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-09-08 13:16:00 &#43;0100">Sep 8, 2021</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that the UK social care crisis will be fixed by the rise in NIC contributions. It sounds to me that the additional tax payable from next April, will be used to drive down the NHS backlog, which was already growing pre-pandemic. The new care reforms are slated to come into effect in late 2023 but the details are sketchy. No mention of reform of the care providers, staff wages and conditions.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson said at PMQs today words to the effect that there will be innovative private firms that will insure you against selling your house to pay for care.</p>
<p>This article is by Stephen Bush, political editor of the New Statesman and is worth a read. Please note that the copyright belongs to The new Statesman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government will increase National Insurance from 12 per cent to 13.25 per cent next year to… do what, exactly? The headline that Boris Johnson wants (and, with a few exceptions in today’s papers, the headline he has got) is that the money is to fix the social care crisis and to reform social care.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you look at the rest of what he, Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid are saying, then the one thing that the government has not done is provide the money to fix the crisis and to reform social care.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, it has hiked taxes in order to spend more money on reducing waiting times in the National Health Service, laid out a broad set of principles about what the balance between the state and private individuals should be in paying for social care, and invented a new way to increase income tax through the so-called health and social care levy, which will come into being as a separate line on payslips from the 2023 tax year. (“So-called” because the costs of health and social care are far in excess of what the levy raises: just like National Insurance, it’s another tool for the Treasury to increase income tax without saying it is increasing income tax.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Politically speaking, Johnson is surely right to believe that mounting NHS waiting times (which were constantly getting longer before the pandemic and are significantly worse now) are a bigger problem for the government today than the social care crisis. But that’s the biggest reason to be dubious about claims that the money for fixing social care is going to come from yesterday’s tax hike: at no point in British political history has money from the NHS been taken back out of it and redirected to elsewhere in the British state, and it seems unlikely, to put it mildly, that we are going to start in three years’ time. So the money for social care will have to come from somewhere else, whether it’s more borrowing, taxes elsewhere, or, the most likely alternative in my view, a big I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-income-tax increase to the health and social care levy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of risks to that approach: the first is that this plan depends on the social care system limping on in its present state, unnoticed by most people, for the next three years. It’s possible that the pressures on social care, the ongoing cuts to local authority budgets, and the ever-growing number of people of all ages in need of social care won’t cause a major crisis before 2023. But it’s equally possible that the problem becomes more acute the wrong side of the next election.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second risk is that the broken manifesto promise and the reality that, for all the talk of ending austerity, the rest of the parliament is going to be one in which spending restraint continues, gives the government a reputation for shiftiness: for breaking its promises and failing to deliver. The comparison that Johnson’s inner circle and the Treasury have kept making is to Gordon Brown’s increase in National Insurance following the 2001 election. The equally important part of Brown’s tax increase is that he didn’t need to do the same thing in 2003, and that by 2005, the NHS was, visibly, in a better state of repair than it had been in 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The big bet that Johnson is making is that, when the next election rolls around, the United Kingdom will feel and look like a country where the crisis in health and social care is being addressed, even if it isn’t really, and even if the difficult decisions are still being put off and the actual task of fixing social care has been kicked into the next parliament.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It beggars belief that the UK government is telling businesses they can dump raw sewage into our rivers because of Brexit-related issues with the supply chain. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Sunlit Uplands&rdquo;</em> will start to stink if this carries on much longer.</p>
<p>This is the quote from today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inside Politics&rdquo; email from The Independent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Brexit just a load of crap? Amid the well-documented supply chain and lorry driver shortage crises, ministers have given businesses the green light to dump the brown stuff in Britain’s rivers. Some companies have found it more difficult to get hold of water treatment chemicals because of supply chain disruption at ports blamed primarily on the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Environment Agency this week said companies struggling to get hold of such products would be allowed to “discharge effluent without meeting the conditions” of their permits, which normally require water to be treated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Green Party is furious. Amelia Womack, deputy leader, said: “This is a failure of their understanding on how our country’s most basic infrastructure works and using our environment as a dumping ground rather than addressing the root causes of the problem. “To prevent further Brexit chaos and undermining of environmental protections, the government must work to mend supply chains and work to cooperate rather than trying to look ‘tough’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The government says the measures are “strictly time-limited and there are robust conditions in place to mitigate risks to the environment”. Maybe best to avoid wild swimming for a while.</p>
