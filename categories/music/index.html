<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to name the record Carolyn’s Boy because Mom never got to see any of my success,” Rucker offered in the interview. “She died before any of this happened, so it’s just another homage to the greatest woman I’ve ever known.”
When asked why he wanted to put this album out now, Rucker shared, “Years ago, I wasn’t really sure what my place in country music was and I was trying to find it. Now I have found it—I know—and I think it’s time to give that record.” 🎶</p>

         	<p>I enjoyed the first episode of &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Gallows Pole<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; on the BBC yesterday. It&rsquo;s the tale of the rise of David Hartley and the Cragg Vale Coiners. Set in the moorland hills of 18th Century Yorkshire, the drama follows the enigmatic David Hartley as he assembles a gang of weavers and land-workers to embark upon a revolutionary criminal enterprise that will capsize the economy and become the biggest fraud in British history.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book, but I suspect it doesn&rsquo;t end well for the Coiners&hellip;</p>
<p>The soundtrack is available on BBC Sounds and on Spotify.</p>

        <a href="https://keithpound.com/2023/04/12/roonnot-only-for.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-04-12 18:04:02 &#43;0100">Apr 12, 2023</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Why invest in Roon when Apple’s Music (the app, not the service) and Spotify are “free?”</em></p>
<p>I wanted to use Apple Music to bring all my music into one place, consisting of over 2,000 albums I&rsquo;ve ripped or purchased that sat on a Synology NAS and music from Apple’s streaming service. Unfortunately, this approach didn&rsquo;t work because Apple struggled to match my albums with the versions on its servers.</p>
<p>After days spent watching Apple Music processing &amp; uploading, I gave up. The workaround was to have two Apple Music libraries, one for digital files and another for streaming music, which wasn&rsquo;t an elegant or practical solution.</p>
<p>I own a Naim Uniti Atom, which supports Apple’s service via AirPlay, but Spotify, Tidal and Qobuz are better integrated. I’ve used Spotify for many years and still have a free account, but the continued lack of high-res content left me looking for another provider. I tried Tidal but grew tired of the way they push music I don’t like at me. Ultimately, I settled on Qobuz, and bought a 12-month subscription.</p>
<p>I still didn’t have all of my music in one place. After some research during the Christmas break, I signed up for a 14-day trial of <a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/czdqgYpSAUmSVciCHmxNpA">Roon</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As a test, I installed Roon on my MacBook Air, pointed it at a subset of my music collection, added my Qobuz subscription, sat back whilst Roon scanned my music and installed the mobile app on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Roon must always be on and connected to the Internet to work correctly, so using my MacBook as the Roon server wasn’t a long-term solution. I couldn’t use my Synology NAS as it was in storage between houses, and the spec was too low to support Roon.</p>
<p>As an interim solution, I bought a &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo; NUC from eBay. I installed Roon ROCK, which is a dedicated operating system and Roon core with the music files located on an external SSD drive. It&rsquo;s a relatively old i5 model but came with 16Gb RAM. It sits in the kitchen, next to the router and has never missed a beat.</p>
<p>It manages almost 30,000 tracks across my music and what I&rsquo;ve saved as favourites in Qobuz.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/czdqgYpSAUmSVciCHmxNpA">Use this link for a free 30-day trial</a>, <em>but be warned—it’s addictive.</em></p>
<p>In Part 2, I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits of using Roon.</p>

         	<p>Listening to &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dub No Frontiers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Adrian Sherwood</p>
<p>This was recommended by i newspaper&rsquo;s Ian Dunt, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really well thought-through collection by British producer Adrian Sherwood, who challenges the male-dominated world of reggae with a female-only album. That&rsquo;s laudable, but this stuff only works where the content is good. What&rsquo;s extraordinary here is the delicate balance of diversity and consistency. It&rsquo;s all elegantly produced, emphasising the vocals, but the vocals veer from Mandarin Chinese to Japanese to Hindi. A really impeccable effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>

         	<p>After the 14 day Tidal trial, it was time to decide to stay with Spotify or move to Tidal. I prefer the new music suggestions that Spotify presents, but much prefer the UI of Tidal. I’ve also got fed up waiting for Spotify to deliver the promised HiFi streaming functionality, which is important to me as I have a Naim streamer that is capable of making good use of the hi-res delivered by Tidal. You guessed it, I’ve moved to Tidal. 🎶</p>

         	<p>I’ve flipped between both over the years, but currently using Spotify as I got a free six-month subscription when I bought a Sonos sound bar before Christmas. That’s about to expire, and it’s time to stump up £9.99 a month.</p>
<p><em>The question is, should I go back to Tidal or stick where I am?</em></p>
<p>I listen to music on my MacBook, iPad, my phone and a couple of Sonos speakers located throughout the house. We also have a Naim streamer in the lounge, which means that I can make the best use of a high-quality source as provided by Tidal’s HiFi tier.</p>
<p>Spotify uses its Connect technology to send music to the Naim, whereas Tidal integrates with the Naim app, making for a more involved experience.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the puzzle is to have a sound off, play the same track on Spotify and Tidal and check whether I can hear a difference between the two to justify paying £20 a month for Tidal.</p>
<p>I’ve signed up for a 30-day Tidal trial. Let the games begin!</p>
