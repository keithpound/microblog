		<p>We moved to South Devon a month ago, renting a renovated barn while looking for our new permanent home. We live a few miles from the coast, in the middle of farming country, which means that in the morning, we explore the local woods and footpaths.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo of Topsham Bridge, taken around 8am yesterday.</p>

<p>Since moving, it&rsquo;s compulsory to go to the coast at the weekend, and yesterday we went to the beach at Thurlestone just before sunset.</p>
