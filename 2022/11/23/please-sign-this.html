<p><strong>UPDATE 17/03/2023: Ban on imports of animal hunting trophies set to become law</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government has backed legislation which would stop hunters from bringing back body parts of thousands of species, including lions, rhinos, elephants and polar bears, killed abroad.
Tory MP Henry Smith, who proposed the bill, said it would help conserve the world&rsquo;s most endangered species.
It was approved by MPs and will now face further scrutiny in the Lords.
As it has the support of the government, the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill is likely to become law.</p>
