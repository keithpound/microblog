<p>“Boris’s rhetoric was bombastic but vacuous and economically illiterate. This was an agenda for levelling down to a centrally-planned, high-tax, low-productivity economy. He is hamstringing the labour market, raising taxes on a fragile recovery and shying away from meaningful planning reform. Shortages and rising prices simply cannot be blustered away with rhetoric about migrants. There is no evidence that immigration lowers living standards for native workers. This dog whistle shows this government doesn’t care about pursuing evidence-based policies.”</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/v6W3gbvCXWQ">Johnson&rsquo;s mask slips</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson has sparked outrage on the eve of the Conservative Party conference after saying “never mind” about cancer death rates and the recent fall in life expectancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grilled about his plans for Britain’s recovery from the Covid crisis, the prime minister chose to emphasis economic growth over health measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Pointing to the recent growth in wages, Mr Johnson told the BBC: “I’ve given you the most important metric – never mind life expectancy, never mind cancer outcomes – look at wage growth.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Opposition parties pounced the prime minister’s remarks, with Labour accusing him of showing an “outrageous” disregard for the health of British citizens.
Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told The Independent: “Boris Johnson starts his conference with the most chilling words ever spoken from a prime minister dismissing the importance of cancer outcomes.”</p>

			 <p>This article from The New Statesman website is a sobering read for those of us lucky enough not to worry too much about the odd £20,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whitehall’s own analysis finds the cut will have a “catastrophic” impact, warning “homelessness and poverty are likely to rise, and food banks usage will soar”. More than half a million people face being pulled below the poverty line, including 200,000 children, as a result of this change, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty organisation.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://keithpound.com/2021/09/08/did-they-fix.html">Did they fix UK social care or just kick the can down the road?</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;m not convinced that the UK social care crisis will be fixed by the rise in NIC contributions. It sounds to me that the additional tax payable from next April, will be used to drive down the NHS backlog, which was already growing pre-pandemic. The new care reforms are slated to come into effect in late 2023 but the details are sketchy. No mention of reform of the care providers, staff wages and conditions.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson said at PMQs today words to the effect that there will be innovative private firms that will insure you against selling your house to pay for care.</p>
<p>This article is by Stephen Bush, political editor of the New Statesman and is worth a read. Please note that the copyright belongs to The new Statesman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The government will increase National Insurance from 12 per cent to 13.25 per cent next year to… do what, exactly? The headline that Boris Johnson wants (and, with a few exceptions in today’s papers, the headline he has got) is that the money is to fix the social care crisis and to reform social care.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But if you look at the rest of what he, Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid are saying, then the one thing that the government has not done is provide the money to fix the crisis and to reform social care.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, it has hiked taxes in order to spend more money on reducing waiting times in the National Health Service, laid out a broad set of principles about what the balance between the state and private individuals should be in paying for social care, and invented a new way to increase income tax through the so-called health and social care levy, which will come into being as a separate line on payslips from the 2023 tax year. (“So-called” because the costs of health and social care are far in excess of what the levy raises: just like National Insurance, it’s another tool for the Treasury to increase income tax without saying it is increasing income tax.)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Politically speaking, Johnson is surely right to believe that mounting NHS waiting times (which were constantly getting longer before the pandemic and are significantly worse now) are a bigger problem for the government today than the social care crisis. But that’s the biggest reason to be dubious about claims that the money for fixing social care is going to come from yesterday’s tax hike: at no point in British political history has money from the NHS been taken back out of it and redirected to elsewhere in the British state, and it seems unlikely, to put it mildly, that we are going to start in three years’ time. So the money for social care will have to come from somewhere else, whether it’s more borrowing, taxes elsewhere, or, the most likely alternative in my view, a big I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-income-tax increase to the health and social care levy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of risks to that approach: the first is that this plan depends on the social care system limping on in its present state, unnoticed by most people, for the next three years. It’s possible that the pressures on social care, the ongoing cuts to local authority budgets, and the ever-growing number of people of all ages in need of social care won’t cause a major crisis before 2023. But it’s equally possible that the problem becomes more acute the wrong side of the next election.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second risk is that the broken manifesto promise and the reality that, for all the talk of ending austerity, the rest of the parliament is going to be one in which spending restraint continues, gives the government a reputation for shiftiness: for breaking its promises and failing to deliver. The comparison that Johnson’s inner circle and the Treasury have kept making is to Gordon Brown’s increase in National Insurance following the 2001 election. The equally important part of Brown’s tax increase is that he didn’t need to do the same thing in 2003, and that by 2005, the NHS was, visibly, in a better state of repair than it had been in 2001.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The big bet that Johnson is making is that, when the next election rolls around, the United Kingdom will feel and look like a country where the crisis in health and social care is being addressed, even if it isn’t really, and even if the difficult decisions are still being put off and the actual task of fixing social care has been kicked into the next parliament.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It beggars belief that the UK government is telling businesses they can dump raw sewage into our rivers because of Brexit-related issues with the supply chain. Boris Johnson&rsquo;s <em>&ldquo;Sunlit Uplands&rdquo;</em> will start to stink if this carries on much longer.</p>
<p>This is the quote from today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inside Politics&rdquo; email from The Independent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is Brexit just a load of crap? Amid the well-documented supply chain and lorry driver shortage crises, ministers have given businesses the green light to dump the brown stuff in Britain’s rivers. Some companies have found it more difficult to get hold of water treatment chemicals because of supply chain disruption at ports blamed primarily on the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Environment Agency this week said companies struggling to get hold of such products would be allowed to “discharge effluent without meeting the conditions” of their permits, which normally require water to be treated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Green Party is furious. Amelia Womack, deputy leader, said: “This is a failure of their understanding on how our country’s most basic infrastructure works and using our environment as a dumping ground rather than addressing the root causes of the problem. “To prevent further Brexit chaos and undermining of environmental protections, the government must work to mend supply chains and work to cooperate rather than trying to look ‘tough’.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The government says the measures are “strictly time-limited and there are robust conditions in place to mitigate risks to the environment”. Maybe best to avoid wild swimming for a while.</p>

<p><em>How to Lose a Country</em> is an impassioned plea, a warning to the world that populism and nationalism don’t march fully-formed into government; they creep. There&rsquo;s a lot about post-Brexit England that I recognised in the book that should concern us all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As one of the panellists, I smiled bitterly as I thought about how all these brilliant journalists were yet to suffer the despair of realising that their tactics were akin to playing chess against a pigeon, as someone once described debating evolution with a creationist: the pigeon will just knock over all the pieces and shit on the board, then depart, proudly claiming victory and leaving the mess behind for you to clean up.</p>

			 <p>After the 14 day Tidal trial, it was time to decide to stay with Spotify or move to Tidal. I prefer the new music suggestions that Spotify presents, but much prefer the UI of Tidal. I’ve also got fed up waiting for Spotify to deliver the promised HiFi streaming functionality, which is important to me as I have a Naim streamer that is capable of making good use of the hi-res delivered by Tidal. You guessed it, I’ve moved to Tidal. 🎶</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve flipped between both over the years, but currently using Spotify as I got a free six-month subscription when I bought a Sonos sound bar before Christmas. That’s about to expire, and it’s time to stump up £9.99 a month.</p>
<p><em>The question is, should I go back to Tidal or stick where I am?</em></p>
<p>I listen to music on my MacBook, iPad, my phone and a couple of Sonos speakers located throughout the house. We also have a Naim streamer in the lounge, which means that I can make the best use of a high-quality source as provided by Tidal’s HiFi tier.</p>
<p>Spotify uses its Connect technology to send music to the Naim, whereas Tidal integrates with the Naim app, making for a more involved experience.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the puzzle is to have a sound off, play the same track on Spotify and Tidal and check whether I can hear a difference between the two to justify paying £20 a month for Tidal.</p>
<p>I’ve signed up for a 30-day Tidal trial. Let the games begin!</p>

			 <p><strong>Goodbye Evernote, hello Craft.</strong> I&rsquo;ve done what I thought was unthinkable. After using Evernote for over a dozen years, I just cancelled my subscription and started using <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a> as my full time note taking application. I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.</p>

			 <p>I’ve just completed the signup process for a Micro.blog subscription and will be moving some posts from my old WordPress site across to micro.blog over the coming days.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to use the Arabica theme for the web and have made a couple of small changes to the Archive page, to keep links looking the same across the site — I didn’t like the Nav bar looking and behaving different from the Categories on the Archive page. I just need to work out how to get the Categories to display horizontally now. I tried to use CSS to style them, but whilst I can change colours, etc., “display: inline” doesn’t work as you&rsquo;ll see below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Happy to take advice from anyone who has more experience using CSS than I do — which’ll be pretty much everyone.</p>
<p>My next challenge is to style the dates on the Archive page to look like the dates on the rest of the theme.</p>
<p>Still to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide whether to keep my old domain name and transfer it to Micro.blog</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, by the way, this post was written in Ulysses and published direct to the blog.</p>

<p>I built my <a href="https://keithpound.com/" title="KeithPound.com">website</a> on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/" title="Elegant Themes site">Elegant Themes</a>. Whilst I’m happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp; Divi provides, it’s difficult to justify the annual cost of around £85 a year for a hobby blog.</p>
<p>Ulysses posts to WordPress but the formatting doesn’t work with the Extra theme, so wasn’t really a viable option. This limitation, coupled with the cost, were the reasons behind why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.</p>
<p>Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward — you just select “Publishing” as the export option and select the blog to post to, it’s status (draft, publish or schedule when it’s posted) and choose a category.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
