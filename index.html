         	<p>I’ve flipped between both over the years, but currently using Spotify as I got a free six-month subscription when I bought a Sonos sound bar before Christmas. That’s about to expire, and it’s time to stump up £9.99 a month.</p>

<p><em>The question is, should I go back to Tidal or stick where I am?</em></p>

<p>I listen to music on my MacBook, iPad, my phone and a couple of Sonos speakers located throughout the house. We also have a Naim streamer in the lounge, which means that I can make the best use of a high-quality source as provided by Tidal’s HiFi tier.</p>

<p>Spotify uses its Connect technology to send music to the Naim, whereas Tidal integrates with the Naim app, making for a more involved experience.</p>

<p>The only way to solve the puzzle is to have a sound off, play the same track on Spotify and Tidal and check whether I can hear a difference between the two to justify paying £20 a month for Tidal.</p>

<p>I’ve signed up for a 30-day Tidal trial. Let the games begin!</p>

I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.

<p>I took this using my Sony a6300 and 16-70mm lens at 70mm. The camera was connected to my iPad via WiFi and I used the Sony app to remotely fire the shutter. The shot was hampered by the short lens and the WiFi signal, which meant i had to position the camera further away from the feeder than was optimum.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I’ve just completed the signup process for a Micro.blog subscription and will be moving some posts from my old WordPress site across to micro.blog over the coming days.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to use the Arabica theme for the web and have made a couple of small changes to the Archive page, to keep links looking the same across the site — I didn’t like the Nav bar looking and behaving different from the Categories on the Archive page. I just need to work out how to get the Categories to display horizontally now. I tried to use CSS to style them, but whilst I can change colours, etc., “display: inline” doesn’t work as you&rsquo;ll see below.</p>

<p><img src="https://KeithPound.micro.blog/uploads/2021/cc7e5ff5e3.png" width="464" height="484" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>Happy to take advice from anyone who has more experience using CSS than I do — which’ll be pretty much everyone.</p>

<p>My next challenge is to style the dates on the Archive page to look like the dates on the rest of the theme.</p>

<p>Still to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Decide whether to keep my old domain name and transfer it to Micro.blog</li>
</ol>

<p>Oh, by the way, this post was written in Ulysses and published direct to the blog.</p>

I have recently started to use <a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses app">Ulysses</a> for all my long and short-form writing and was intrigued to read that the authors added the ability to publish to micro.blog in the latest release.</p>

<p>I built my <a href="https://keithpound.com/" title="KeithPound.com">website</a> on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/" title="Elegant Themes site">Elegant Themes</a>. Whilst I’m happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp; Divi provides, it’s difficult to justify the annual cost of around £85 a year for a hobby blog.</p>

<p>Ulysses posts to WordPress but the formatting doesn’t work with the Extra theme, so wasn’t really a viable option. This limitation, coupled with the cost, were the reasons behind why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.</p>

<p>Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward — you just select “Publishing” as the export option and select the blog to post to, it’s status (draft, publish or schedule when it’s posted) and choose a category.<br>

<p> We visited New York in March 2019 and booked a trip up the Rockefeller Centre. Unfortunately, it was very cloudy and we were presented with a whiteout, so photographing the NY skyline was out of the question and meant that I had to concentrate on the details.</p>

         	<p>It&rsquo;s been a tough year for us all, but many artists released some great new music during 2020. I&rsquo;ve listened to dozens of new albums, and this playlist includes some of what I thought was the best tracks.</p>

<p>My Album of the Year had to be<em> Letter to You</em> from Bruce Springsteen.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy some of the tracks I&rsquo;ve chosen. Leave a comment with <strong>your suggestions.</strong></p>

<p><strong> See you in 2021!</strong></p>

<p>One of my <a href="http://www.itfmradio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITfM Radio</a> colleagues challenged his Facebook buddies to list their top 12 go-to albums recently. The aim was not to overthink the list, but to put down whatever came to mind.</p>

<p>That was never going to happen and it took me about a week to come up with this list.</p>
