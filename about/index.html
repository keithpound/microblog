	<h1>About</h1>
	<div><p>During the day, I run the sales and marketing team for an IT software and services company. In the actual world, Iâ€™m married to Janet, have two grown-up kids and a barking-mad springer/poodle cross called Parker. I take photos, make our garden wildlife-friendly, drink wine, and listen to music. We live in South #Devon</p>
