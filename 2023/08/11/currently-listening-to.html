<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to name the record Carolyn’s Boy because Mom never got to see any of my success,” Rucker offered in the interview. “She died before any of this happened, so it’s just another homage to the greatest woman I’ve ever known.”
When asked why he wanted to put this album out now, Rucker shared, “Years ago, I wasn’t really sure what my place in country music was and I was trying to find it. Now I have found it—I know—and I think it’s time to give that record.” 🎶</p>
