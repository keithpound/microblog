		<p>I enjoyed the first episode of &ldquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Gallows Pole<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&rdquo; on the BBC yesterday. It&rsquo;s the tale of the rise of David Hartley and the Cragg Vale Coiners. Set in the moorland hills of 18th Century Yorkshire, the drama follows the enigmatic David Hartley as he assembles a gang of weavers and land-workers to embark upon a revolutionary criminal enterprise that will capsize the economy and become the biggest fraud in British history.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book, but I suspect it doesn&rsquo;t end well for the Coiners&hellip;</p>
<p>The soundtrack is available on BBC Sounds and on Spotify.</p>
