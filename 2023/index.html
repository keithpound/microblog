<p>Thames Water has pumped at least 72bn litres of sewage into the River Thames since 2020 – roughly equal to 29,000 Olympic swimming pools – new figures reveal.</p>

         	<p>Did you know that raw sewage is being dumped into English waterways the equivalent of 800 times a day?</p>
<p>Water companies treat our blue spaces like an open sewer. Meanwhile government and regulators continue to turn a blind eye. This needs to stop.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me and agree that PM Rishi Sunak should take action to stop sewage pollution in UK rivers and beaches, please add your name to the Greenpeace petition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I wanted to name the record Carolyn’s Boy because Mom never got to see any of my success,” Rucker offered in the interview. “She died before any of this happened, so it’s just another homage to the greatest woman I’ve ever known.”
When asked why he wanted to put this album out now, Rucker shared, “Years ago, I wasn’t really sure what my place in country music was and I was trying to find it. Now I have found it—I know—and I think it’s time to give that record.” 🎶</p>

         	<p>I enjoyed the first episode of &ldquo;<em>The Gallows Pole</em>&rdquo; on the BBC yesterday. It&rsquo;s the tale of the rise of David Hartley and the Cragg Vale Coiners. Set in the moorland hills of 18th Century Yorkshire, the drama follows the enigmatic David Hartley as he assembles a gang of weavers and land-workers to embark upon a revolutionary criminal enterprise that will capsize the economy and become the biggest fraud in British history.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t read the book, but I suspect it doesn&rsquo;t end well for the Coiners&hellip;</p>
<p>The soundtrack is available on BBC Sounds and on Spotify.</p>

<p>Water companies apologise for sewage spills and pledge £10bn of investment, but critics say it&rsquo;s too little
England’s water and sewage companies have apologised for polluting rivers and beaches and pledged that more will be done to end it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruth Kelly, chair of Water UK, the industry body, said that the public was “right to be upset” and that “more should have been done” to limit sewage spills.</p>

<p><em>Image source inews/Robert Brook/Getty</em></p>
<p>Since privatisation, the water companies have taken billions of pounds in dividends while delivering polluted rivers and beaches. They must pay to clean this up and not pass the costs on to their hard-pressed customers. Unfortunately, the regulator and government don&rsquo;t seem to be on the side of the public.</p>

         	<p>If you live in the UK, you will have noticed the increased level of interest in the discharge of sewage into our rivers and seas. The government is concerned about the impact of this on the upcoming local elections and is talking tough but doing nothing.</p>
<p>The situation with raw sewage also affects businesses. For instance, we live in South Devon, where we are fortunate to have access to some of the best beaches in the UK. One of which, Blackpool Sands was voted the &ldquo;best beach in Britain,” according to the blurb on the <a href="https://www.blackpoolsands.co.uk/" title="Link to the Blackpool Sands website">website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature’s golden beach, set in an unspoilt, sheltered bay, lapped by clear blue water and surrounded by magnificent evergreens and pines. Blackpool Sands is the ideal family beach to relax, swim or sail. But don’t just take our word for it – come and see for yourself! Relax or play; it’s South Devon’s most beautiful beach any day!</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="uploads/2023/48e40598d6.png" width="600" height="400" alt="photo of Blackpool sands, devon, uk" border=“1” />
<p>The owners of Blackpool Sands have invested a lot of money over the winter in new and upgraded facilities. I can&rsquo;t imagine how they feel learning that, according to the Independent newspaper, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/beach-sewage-water-pollution-england-b2315279.html" title="Link to the Independent article">Blackpool Sands ranks the worst for seaside sewage spillage</a> as shown in the following graphic.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/6cef3b0ccf.png" width="600" height="382" alt="graphic showing polluted beaches in the south-west, uk" border=“1” />
<p>Since privatisation in 1989, private water companies in England* have underinvested in pollution prevention to boost profits*.</p>
<p><strong>They’ve built a debt mountain of £53bn, while giving shareholders £72bn!</strong></p>
<p>Attempts to regulate them have failed. Under privatisation, it clearly pays to pollute.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. The UK’s most trusted utility company is publicly owned Scottish Water. They’ve spent £72 more per household per year than English water companies. That’s equivalent to an extra £28 billion being invested in England’s water network!</p>

         	<p>In case you’re still wondering who to vote for in this May’s local elections, here’s a list of Tory achievements during the last thirteen years:</p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 sure start centres closed.</li>
<li>780 libraries closed.</li>
<li>700 football pitches closed.</li>
<li>Food bank use is up 5,400%.</li>
<li>Homelessness is up 1,000%.</li>
<li>Rough sleeping up 1,200%</li>
<li>Evictions at record highs.</li>
<li>Student fees are up 300%.</li>
<li>Student debt has risen 150%.</li>

<li>10,000 fewer border officials.</li>
<li>10,000 fewer firefighters.</li>
<li>10,000 fewer medical professionals.</li>
<li>14,000 fewer bed spaces for mental illness.</li>
<li>Creation of 1.3m jobs, mainly temporary, self-employed, gig economy and Zero Hours Contract.</li>
<li>Only 30k full-time work positions were created.</li>
<li>25% cuts for our disabled community.</li>
<li>80% cuts to Mobility allowance.</li>
<li>Closing Remploy.</li>
<li>40% of working households with practically no savings.</li>
<li>70% of households have less than 10k savings.</li>
<li>60% of households can only survive 2 months without a wage.</li>
<li>Increase of 50% in hate crimes.</li>
<li>Increase knife crime by 150% to 22,000 per year.</li>
<li>Life expectancy down 3 years.</li>
<li>Voted down a bill which would have forced landlords to make their rental properties fit for human habitation</li>

<li>36,000 fewer teachers.</li>
<li>Six form funding cut by 25%.</li>
<li>33,000 nurses leave the NHS each year.</li>
<li>14 prisons closed down, and the land was sold to developers.</li>
<li>50% of all police stations closed.</li>
<li>300 + courts closed down, leading to a huge backlog.</li>
<li>Millions to a shipping company with no ships</li>
<li>Economy the worst in Europe</li>
<li>Billions to Tory Donors for PPE that either didn&rsquo;t work or never turned up.</li>
<li>Brexit deal that has seen the economy drop even further and exports evaporate.</li>
<li>Repeatedly broke laws they&rsquo;d only just made and had parties whilst the rest sacrificed</li>
<li>Largest tax increase for 70 years whilst the chancellor&rsquo;s wife and rich people like her simply avoid it.</li>
<li>Crashed the pound.</li>
<li>Chancellor of the Exchequer on the fiddle and fined by HMRC</li>
<li>Voted to allow water companies to dump raw sewage in our rivers and seas for the next 15 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all bad news, though. Although inflation is at a 40-year high, at least corporate profits are at 70-year record levels, so that’s good.</p>
<p>PS - here’s a tip for any grovelling Tory apologists. Save time and brain-ache by selecting one or more of the following responses:</p>
<p>Option 1 response “None of this is true”</p>
<p>Option 2 response “It’s all true, but it&rsquo;s Labour’s fault”</p>
<p>Option 3 response “More leftie nonsense”</p>
<p>Option 4 response “Labour would have been worse”</p>

         	<p>Despite it raining in Devon almost every day since we moved here in October last year, South West Water is imposing a hosepipe ban on us from 25th April.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/caafe8d9f4.png" width="600" height="314" alt="south west water hosepipe ban" />
<blockquote>
<p>Since last summer, our region has been in drought.  Low rainfall and high demand have stopped our reservoirs from recovering to levels we would usually see going into the summer.  Roadford Lake, our main reservoir in Devon, remains around 27% lower than this time last year, despite the recent rain. To see our latest reservoir levels, please visit our website <a href="https://southwestwater-email.co.uk/1FMM-89KXU-CYUVOI-54FCEP-1/c.aspx">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must rethink how our utilities are run, as these companies have a monopoly over the consumer. We have no choice over who supplies our water, so they can charge what they like and impose restrictions on the service.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>Why invest in Roon when Apple’s Music (the app, not the service) and Spotify are “free?”</em></p>
<p>I wanted to use Apple Music to bring all my music into one place, consisting of over 2,000 albums I&rsquo;ve ripped or purchased that sat on a Synology NAS and music from Apple’s streaming service. Unfortunately, this approach didn&rsquo;t work because Apple struggled to match my albums with the versions on its servers.</p>
<p>After days spent watching Apple Music processing &amp; uploading, I gave up. The workaround was to have two Apple Music libraries, one for digital files and another for streaming music, which wasn&rsquo;t an elegant or practical solution.</p>
<p>I own a Naim Uniti Atom, which supports Apple’s service via AirPlay, but Spotify, Tidal and Qobuz are better integrated. I’ve used Spotify for many years and still have a free account, but the continued lack of high-res content left me looking for another provider. I tried Tidal but grew tired of the way they push music I don’t like at me. Ultimately, I settled on Qobuz, and bought a 12-month subscription.</p>
<p>I still didn’t have all of my music in one place. After some research during the Christmas break, I signed up for a 14-day trial of <a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/czdqgYpSAUmSVciCHmxNpA">Roon</a>.</p>
<img src="uploads/2023/bafd997964.png" alt="Roon advert" title="roon.png" border="1" width="599" height="442" />
<p>As a test, I installed Roon on my MacBook Air, pointed it at a subset of my music collection, added my Qobuz subscription, sat back whilst Roon scanned my music and installed the mobile app on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Roon must always be on and connected to the Internet to work correctly, so using my MacBook as the Roon server wasn’t a long-term solution. I couldn’t use my Synology NAS as it was in storage between houses, and the spec was too low to support Roon.</p>
<p>As an interim solution, I bought a &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo; NUC from eBay. I installed Roon ROCK, which is a dedicated operating system and Roon core with the music files located on an external SSD drive. It&rsquo;s a relatively old i5 model but came with 16Gb RAM. It sits in the kitchen, next to the router and has never missed a beat.</p>
<p>It manages almost 30,000 tracks across my music and what I&rsquo;ve saved as favourites in Qobuz.</p>

         	<p>Listening to &hellip; <em>Dub No Frontiers</em> by Adrian Sherwood</p>
<p>This was recommended by i newspaper&rsquo;s Ian Dunt, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really well thought-through collection by British producer Adrian Sherwood, who challenges the male-dominated world of reggae with a female-only album. That&rsquo;s laudable, but this stuff only works where the content is good. What&rsquo;s extraordinary here is the delicate balance of diversity and consistency. It&rsquo;s all elegantly produced, emphasising the vocals, but the vocals veer from Mandarin Chinese to Japanese to Hindi. A really impeccable effort.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Our threatened seabirds need your help. The UK Government could make the game-changing decision to ban industrial sandeel fishing in English waters.  Please take action today to help make it happen</strong>.</p>
<p>Sandeels are massively important for UK sea life. They&rsquo;re a vital food source for many seabirds, including puffins and kittiwakes, globally threatened with extinction. Every summer, hundreds of thousands of UK birds rely on them to feed their young. But right now, sandeels are under immense pressure.</p>

         	<p>We are very lucky to have taken over an allotment in our new village, just a few minutes walk from home.</p>

<p>As seen in the photos, it&rsquo;s not been worked for a couple of years and is overgrown with weeds and grass.</p>

<p>We plan to renovate &amp; plant half the beds this year &amp; get the others ready for next season.</p>
