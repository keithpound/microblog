		<p>Listening to &hellip; <em>Dub No Frontiers</em> by Adrian Sherwood</p>
<p>This was recommended by i newspaper&rsquo;s Ian Dunt, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really well thought-through collection by British producer Adrian Sherwood, who challenges the male-dominated world of reggae with a female-only album. That&rsquo;s laudable, but this stuff only works where the content is good. What&rsquo;s extraordinary here is the delicate balance of diversity and consistency. It&rsquo;s all elegantly produced, emphasising the vocals, but the vocals veer from Mandarin Chinese to Japanese to Hindi. A really impeccable effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.</p>
