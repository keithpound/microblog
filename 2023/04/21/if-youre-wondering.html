<li>14 prisons closed down, and the land was sold to developers.</li>

<p>PS - here’s a tip for any grovelling Tory apologists. Save time and brain-ache by selecting one or more of the following responses:</p>
<p>Option 1 response “None of this is true”</p>
<p>Option 2 response “It’s all true, but it&rsquo;s Labour’s fault”</p>
<p>Option 3 response “More leftie nonsense”</p>
<p>Option 4 response “Labour would have been worse”</p>
