		<p><em>Why invest in Roon when Apple’s Music (the app, not the service) and Spotify are “free?”</em></p>
<p>I wanted to use Apple Music to bring all my music into one place, consisting of over 2,000 albums I&rsquo;ve ripped or purchased that sat on a Synology NAS and music from Apple’s streaming service. Unfortunately, this approach didn&rsquo;t work because Apple struggled to match my albums with the versions on its servers.</p>
<p>After days spent watching Apple Music processing &amp; uploading, I gave up. The workaround was to have two Apple Music libraries, one for digital files and another for streaming music, which wasn&rsquo;t an elegant or practical solution.</p>
<p>I own a Naim Uniti Atom, which supports Apple’s service via AirPlay, but Spotify, Tidal and Qobuz are better integrated. I’ve used Spotify for many years and still have a free account, but the continued lack of high-res content left me looking for another provider. I tried Tidal but grew tired of the way they push music I don’t like at me. Ultimately, I settled on Qobuz, and bought a 12-month subscription.</p>
<p>I still didn’t have all of my music in one place. After some research during the Christmas break, I signed up for a 14-day trial of <a href="https://roonlabs.com/r/czdqgYpSAUmSVciCHmxNpA">Roon</a>.</p>

<p>As a test, I installed Roon on my MacBook Air, pointed it at a subset of my music collection, added my Qobuz subscription, sat back whilst Roon scanned my music and installed the mobile app on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Roon must always be on and connected to the Internet to work correctly, so using my MacBook as the Roon server wasn’t a long-term solution. I couldn’t use my Synology NAS as it was in storage between houses, and the spec was too low to support Roon.</p>
<p>As an interim solution, I bought a &ldquo;previously enjoyed&rdquo; NUC from eBay. I installed Roon ROCK, which is a dedicated operating system and Roon core with the music files located on an external SSD drive. It&rsquo;s a relatively old i5 model but came with 16Gb RAM. It sits in the kitchen, next to the router and has never missed a beat.</p>
<p>It manages almost 30,000 tracks across my music and what I&rsquo;ve saved as favourites in Qobuz.</p>

<p>In Part 2, I&rsquo;ll talk about some of the benefits of using Roon.</p>
