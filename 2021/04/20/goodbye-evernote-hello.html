		<p><strong>Goodbye Evernote, hello Craft.</strong> I&rsquo;ve done what I thought was unthinkable. After using Evernote for over a dozen years, I just cancelled my subscription and started using <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft</a> as my full time note taking application. I tried to stay loyal to Evernote, but feel they are slipping behind and I really like what the team at Craft are doing. All that&rsquo;s missing are tables (on the way) and a web clipper, also on the development list.</p>
