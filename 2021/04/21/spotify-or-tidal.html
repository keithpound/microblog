		<p>Iâ€™ve flipped between both over the years, but currently using Spotify as I got a free six-month subscription when I bought a Sonos sound bar before Christmas. Thatâ€™s about to expire, and itâ€™s time to stump up Â£9.99 a month.</p>
<p><em>The question is, should I go back to Tidal or stick where I am?</em></p>
<p>I listen to music on my MacBook, iPad, my phone and a couple of Sonos speakers located throughout the house. We also have a Naim streamer in the lounge, which means that I can make the best use of a high-quality source as provided by Tidalâ€™s HiFi tier.</p>
<p>Spotify uses its Connect technology to send music to the Naim, whereas Tidal integrates with the Naim app, making for a more involved experience.</p>
<p>The only way to solve the puzzle is to have a sound off, play the same track on Spotify and Tidal and check whether I can hear a difference between the two to justify paying Â£20 a month for Tidal.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve signed up for a 30-day Tidal trial. Let the games begin!</p>
