		<p>I’ve just completed the signup process for a Micro.blog subscription and will be moving some posts from my old WordPress site across to micro.blog over the coming days.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to use the Arabica theme for the web and have made a couple of small changes to the Archive page, to keep links looking the same across the site — I didn’t like the Nav bar looking and behaving different from the Categories on the Archive page. I just need to work out how to get the Categories to display horizontally now. I tried to use CSS to style them, but whilst I can change colours, etc., “display: inline” doesn’t work as you&rsquo;ll see below.</p>

<p>Happy to take advice from anyone who has more experience using CSS than I do — which’ll be pretty much everyone.</p>
<p>My next challenge is to style the dates on the Archive page to look like the dates on the rest of the theme.</p>
<p>Still to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide whether to keep my old domain name and transfer it to Micro.blog</li>
</ol>
<p>Oh, by the way, this post was written in Ulysses and published direct to the blog.</p>
