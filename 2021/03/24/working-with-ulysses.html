<p>I have recently started to use <a href="https://ulysses.app/" title="Ulysses app">Ulysses</a> for all my extended and short-form writing and was intrigued to read that the authors added the ability to publish to micro.blog in the latest release.</p>
<p>I built my <a href="https://keithpound.com/" title="KeithPound.com">website</a> on WordPress using the Extra theme and Divi builder from <a href="https://www.elegantthemes.com/" title="Elegant Themes site">Elegant Themes</a>. Whilst I’m happy with the features and functionality that Extra &amp; Divi provides, it’s difficult to justify the annual cost of around £85 a year for a hobby blog.</p>
<p>Ulysses posts to WordPress, but the formatting doesn’t work with the Extra theme, so it wasn’t a viable option. This limitation and the cost were why I was looking for an alternative blogging platform.</p>
<p>Setting up Ulysses to post to micro.blog was simple and took less than a minute. Exporting to micro.blog is also straightforward — you select “Publishing” as the export option and select the blog to post to, its status (draft, publish or schedule when it’s posted), and choose a category. 📝<br></p>
