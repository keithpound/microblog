		<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780008294045">How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship</a> by Ece Temelkuran ðŸ“š</p>
<p><em>How to Lose a Country</em> is an impassioned plea, a warning to the world that populism and nationalism donâ€™t march fully-formed into government; they creep. There&rsquo;s a lot about post-Brexit England that I recognised in the book that should concern us all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As one of the panellists, I smiled bitterly as I thought about how all these brilliant journalists were yet to suffer the despair of realising that their tactics were akin to playing chess against a pigeon, as someone once described debating evolution with a creationist: the pigeon will just knock over all the pieces and shit on the board, then depart, proudly claiming victory and leaving the mess behind for you to clean up.</p>
