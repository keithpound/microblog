		<p>One of the best lines in <em>Kier Starmer&rsquo;s</em> speech at the Labour Party Conference yesterday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s easy to comfort yourself that your opponents are bad people. But I don’t think Boris Johnson is a bad man. I think he is a trivial man. I think he’s a showman with nothing left to show. I think he’s a trickster who has performed his one trick.”</p>
