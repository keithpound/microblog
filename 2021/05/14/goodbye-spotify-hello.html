		<p>After the 14 day Tidal trial, it was time to decide to stay with Spotify or move to Tidal. I prefer the new music suggestions that Spotify presents, but much prefer the UI of Tidal. Iâ€™ve also got fed up waiting for Spotify to deliver the promised HiFi streaming functionality, which is important to me as I have a Naim streamer that is capable of making good use of the hi-res delivered by Tidal. You guessed it, Iâ€™ve moved to Tidal. ðŸŽ¶</p>
