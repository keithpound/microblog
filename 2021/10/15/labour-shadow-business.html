		<p>Labour shadow business and energy secretary Ed Miliband on Kwarteng.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is a new low for government energy policy. Reduced to crossing his fingers for a mild winter, Kwasi Kwarteng is showing just how much a decade of inaction from the government has left us vulnerable. Kwasi Kwarteng is the business secretary, not a weatherman. It is cold comfort for businesses and families that this is all he has to offer.”</p>
