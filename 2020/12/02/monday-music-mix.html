		<p>It&rsquo;s been a tough year for us all, but many artists released some great new music during 2020. I&rsquo;ve listened to dozens of new albums, and this playlist includes some of what I thought was the best tracks.</p>
<p>My Album of the Year had to be<em> Letter to You</em> from Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy some of the tracks I&rsquo;ve chosen. Leave a comment with <strong>your suggestions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Â See you in 2021!</strong></p>
